# Monsoon iOS 

###Known Issue & Warnings

- Applications using Launch Screen Files and targetting iOS 7.1 and earlier need to also include a Launch Image in an Asset Catalog.

- Tested on iPhone4s running 7.1 only due to time/device constraints. Will test on all devices in the future (Deploy target 6.0)

- The circular ring is cut off a bit (see screenshot). Possible causes might be the sizing/position in storyboard

- Some Text Labels are not prefectly sized & positions. Will polish further. 

###Features

- The Custom UIControl is accessible via storyboard.
- Circular segments changes color when value changes (or maybe this is a requirement?)


###To-Do

- Animations and sounds
